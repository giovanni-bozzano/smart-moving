# Player API

This is a porting to 1.15.2 of Player API (originally developed by Divisor and deprecated in 1.12.1). The mod has been rewritten to use mixins.


Player API is an API which provides access to the client class "ClientEntityPlayer" and the server class "ServerEntityPlayer" while minimizing conflicts between mods.
